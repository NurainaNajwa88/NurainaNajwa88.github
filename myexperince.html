<br>
<br>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana">When I was still a kid, I live in Kampung Sungai Kerang Teluk Intan Perak mostly with my grandparents before I move to live with my parents in Kedah. I stay at Perak start the day of my birth because that was my mother’s hometown and since my grandparents and great-grandma want to take care of me since I was their first grandchild and great-grandchild. For a several years, my parents and I stay in Perak I was 5 years old my parents will back and forth between Kedah and Perak while I stay at Perak with my grandparents until I reach 7 years old. Both of my grandparents are working at oil palm plantations and my grandfather always bring me with him to his work place from the morning until his working time end. In the midnight which my grandfather has a night shift in his workplace, he will bring me together with him even when I was already sleeping. When I woke up, sometimes I found myself sleep in the car or in my grandfather cottage and I keep wondering how I got there, is it still a dream and I don’t wake up yet or am I sleepwalking to my grandfather car. Then one day, I pretend to be asleep and I found out that my grandfather supported me into the car and went the workplace together with him. 
 
While I was stay at my grandfather workplace, I learn that they were working on oil palm plantation. The oil palm tree grown only in the tropics, the oil palm tree produces high-quality oil used primarily for cooking in developing countries. It is also used in food products, detergents, cosmetics and, to a small extent, biofuel. The company of oil palm in Malaysia is of The world's second-largest oil palm plantation company, FELDA Global Ventures Holdings (FGV) and that where my grandfather work at.

<p align="center"><font face="verdana">The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) is a Malaysian government agency that was founded to handle the resettlement of rural poor into newly developed areas (colonies, settlements or schemes) and to organize smallholder farms growing cash crops. While I was there, I can see how the worker work in the oil palm farms. The process where they collect the oil palm, palm fruit unloading, cleaning and storage platform during palm oil mill processing. I also take a walk and surrounding the plantations along with my grandfather. Then this is some of the experience of my childhood.</font>

<b><u><p align>Program Latihan Khidmat Negara(PLKN)</p></b></u>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana">There one more my favorites experience and memories which is my involvement in Program Latihan Khidmat Negara (PLKN) and 2 months at there. Program Latihan Khidmat Negara (PLKN) or the National Service Training Programme, known locally as the Khidmat Negara ("National Service") was Malaysia's national service program under the Barisan Nasional (BN) government. The programme was handled by the National Service Training Department, or Jabatan Latihan Khidmat Negara (JLKN) under the Minister of Defence (MINDEF). The conscripts are 18-year-old youths that are selectively drafted to join this programme. This is two-month program, originally PLKN was a three month programme, but the government reduces it to be two month programme. I had the opportunity to attend this program in January 2018 right after I graduate from Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) that was end in 2017 at one of the PLKN specific place of a PLKN programme which is Dusun Minda Resorts (DMR) that was state at Kuala Nerang Kedah. The objective of PLKN is to begin as way to encourage friendship between youths of certain ages from different races and ethnic groups and address concerns that the country's multi-ethnic and multi-cultural groups who were seen of becoming increasingly isolated from one another.</p></font>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana">The participant of the programme will gather together at one place before we take a different route to our specific camp place. When we gather together, I can really see that this program is indeed for multi-cultural of Malaysian. There are Malays, Chinese, Indian, Sikh, and Siamese participate in this program. I get to know new people with different race and make friend with them. This programme is really interesting and satisfying program. There is a lot of interesting activities that was held in PLKN. 
One of the famous activities in PLKN of course is marching, it’s already well known to the people because marching is main activities in PLKN.</font>
<br>
<font face="verdana">i will share some interesting video about Hakka offering.</font>
<a href="https://youtu.be/nFJ_Mxi6IpU">Hakka offerings</a>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana">It is a popular and well known to societies about what the most thing they know about PLKN. This camp is located at Kampung Pisang, Jalan Padang Sanai, Kuala Nerang and it was surrounded by rubber plantations and close to hilly areas and forests. due to it’s geographical, no wonder there a lot of outdoor activities related to nature such as camping, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, and rock climbing. Outdoor activities really good for our health, research shows that those who exercise outdoors burn 10% more calories when we walk or run than we do when we work out on a treadmill at the same speed. When exercising outdoors, the distractions of our surroundings take our mind off the work of working out. As a result, there’s a much greater chance that we’ll end up exercising longer than exercising indoors. 
Exercising outdoors isn’t just good for your physical health.  It helps with our mental health as well. Spending time in nature and the natural light can improve our mood and reduce stress and depression. Engaging in physical activity produces similar benefits and often times relaxes and cheers people up. Outdoor exercise also stimulates all five senses in a way that indoor activities cannot. Additionally, being out in nature impacts the brain in a positive way, making we feel better about ourselves.
