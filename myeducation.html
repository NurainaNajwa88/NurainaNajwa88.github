<font face="verdana"><p align="center">Currently, I was a student University Technology MARA Kedah under Faculty of Information Management for programme Bachelor of Information Science (Hons) Librarian Management. Iâ€™m already in semester 3 this year in 2021. 
Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sanglang Perlis has 4 class for each batch. From form I to 3, I was in class called KPG, it was a second class in name. In all four classes, only the alpha class was for students who chose Arabic subjects, while other classes took the same subjects. My class teach basic subjects and we also learn geography, life skills such as cooking, agriculture sewing and arts. I still do my art until now such as sketching and drawing.

<font face="verdana"><p align="center">Does you know what is social science?</p></font>
<font face="verdana"><p align="center">Social science is, in its broadest sense, the study of society and the manner in which people behave and influence the world around us.
Social science tells us about the world beyond our immediate experience, and can help explain how our own society works - from the causes of unemployment or what helps economic growth, to how and why people vote, or what makes people happy. It provides vital information for governments and policymakers, local authorities, non-governmental organisations and others.</p></font>
